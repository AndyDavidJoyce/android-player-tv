		"description": "In June this year, Britain voted to leave the European Union and - depending on how negotiations go - its single market structure. One important aspect of Brexit that wasn't widely discussed at the time was how leaving the Union might affect farming and the subsidies paid to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy or CAP. That's important because 70% of the UK's land area is farmed in one way or another - which has an enormous impact on wildlife and the environment - and a staggering amount of money flows from the EU into UK farming: Once we leave the EU farmers will no longer be eligible for that support - and, potentially, no longer regulated by EU directives that protect the UK's habitats and wildlife.In this interview Charlie Moores discusses these and other issues with Miles King, a professional ecologist and conservationist and author of a report called 'Pebble in the Pond' which is subtitled 'Opportunities for farming, food and nature after Brexit', Miles' report (which is available from peopleneednature.org.uk) looks in depth at subsidies, legislation, small holdings, public goods, natural capital and our relationship with nature and food.\n",

He has now been quietly setting the Global Agenda for change for over 50 years\nOn his 80th birthday Satish stood down as editor-in-chief of Resurgence magazine, a post he had held since 1973 , but he isn’t settling for an easy retirement. He will stay on at the Resurgence Trust and advise his replacement, Greg Neale, who for two years has overseen the print magazine. He also continues to teach at Schumacher college as well as continuing to tour with public speaking engagements.\nSatish came to visit Lush in Poole to talk about his trinity of Soil, Soul and Society - which is also the title and subject of his 2013 book.\n",
