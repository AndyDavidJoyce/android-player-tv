		"description": "Dog fighting as a ‘sport’ was banned in 1835, as even then it was considered barbaric. But this horrific form of dog abuse still goes on. Forcing dogs to fight each other is a devastating betrayal of the trust that dogs put in humans. The League Against Cruel Sports recently launched Project Bloodline - an operation aimed at discovering the why, where and when of dog fighting. Lush's Charlie Moores recently sat down with an investigator contracted to the League to discuss this vile and indefensible activity. (Operational details are understandably protected of course and the investigator's voice has been disguised digitally.)\n",

		"description": "Every Boxing Day the rump of what remains of Britain's fox hunts meet up with their horses and dogs and parade through country villages. Depending on your point of view they are either a thrilling sight in their scarlet or green uniforms or simply a nuisance that block narrow roads and disturb what should be a pleasant Boxing Day walk. This gathering of the clans is, though, a statement of intent, because though chasing wild animals with dogs has been illegal for more than a decade many hunts haven't yet given up on what they claim is a traditional and well-supported country sport. So what's the reality - is fox hunting a well-supported sport or an anachronistic and illegal minority activity that serves no purpose in a modern country? Lush's Charlie Moores asked Eduardo Goncalves, chief-executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, what he thinks about the Boxing Day Hunts.\n",

		"description": "In October 2016 Dr Mark Avery, a former Conservation Director of the RSPB, was in Parliament to debate a petition to ban driven grouse shooting, which as most respected conservationists acknowledge has led to widespread raptor persecution and the near extinction of the Hen Harrier as a breeding bird in England. Those of us who watched the debate - either at the Commons or online - were not expecting too much given how the parliamentary evidence gathering session a few weeks before had gone, where Mark and Jeff Knott, the RSPB Head of Nature Policy, had come up against a belligerent and seemingly dismissive committee of MPs who were almost wholly supportive of the grouse shooting industry. As expected, the proceedings were less of a debate than a reassurance to grouse shooters that - as far as these particular MPs were concerned - nothing was going to change. Charlie Moores met up with Mark in November to chat about what had been a very long campaign and ask what - given Mark's recent experiences - was his current opinion of Parliamentary democracy.\n",
