		"date": "03/01/2017",
		"description": "In June this year, Britain voted to leave the European Union and - depending on how negotiations go - its single market structure. One important aspect of Brexit that wasn't widely discussed at the time was how leaving the Union might affect farming and the subsidies paid to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy or CAP. That's important because 70% of the UK's land area is farmed in one way or another - which has an enormous impact on wildlife and the environment - and a staggering amount of money flows from the EU into UK farming: Once we leave the EU farmers will no longer be eligible for that support - and, potentially, no longer regulated by EU directives that protect the UK's habitats and wildlife.In this interview Charlie Moores discusses these and other issues with Miles King, a professional ecologist and conservationist and author of a report called 'Pebble in the Pond' which is subtitled 'Opportunities for farming, food and nature after Brexit', Miles' report (which is available from peopleneednature.org.uk) looks in depth at subsidies, legislation, small holdings, public goods, natural capital and our relationship with nature and food.\n",
