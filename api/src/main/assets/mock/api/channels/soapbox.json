		"description": "Two women a week are murdered by a current or ex partner in England and Wales. Austerity is making it harder for women to find safety from domestic violence, cuts to benefits are making women poorer which makes it harder for them to leave abusive partners, and a lack of social housing means that women often literally have nowhere to go. Sisters Uncut are a feminist direct-action collective, united by their desire to campaign for better domestic violence services. Three members of Sisters Uncut spoke to Lush's Olivia Graham and explained to her what the collective does and what it aims to achieve.\n",
